# Spending Tracker

## Description

This interactive program tracks all of your spending and consumption behaviors, providing you with useful reports and 
even alerting you when you are running low on a particular grocery item.
Users can create records of their purchasing history, including attributes like vendor, item purchased, date, purchase
price, and category.
Users can then retrieve reports about their spending habits, such as how much of their monthly budget
is still available, or where is the cheapest vendor for buying a particular grocery item.
